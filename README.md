Converge Programming Task

My setup involved using Postman to make GET, PUT, POST, DELETE requests and using robomongo as the DataBase to send
the entries to. 

Since I use mongodb before the server will successfully function you need to have mongodb running in the background. 
I acheive this using the following commands.

> mongod

> sudo service mongodb start
